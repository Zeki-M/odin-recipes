    <p>
        Pasta salad is a staple for any picnic or outdoor gathering. 
        This is an easy salad to prepare and share with friends and family, 
        going with just about anything on your menu. 
        Keep it cool with fresh cold cucumbers. 
        I usually add olives to my pasta salad for a salty, briny bite.
